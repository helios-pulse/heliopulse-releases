# HelioPulse for Home Assistant

Experimental distribution of HelioPulse for Home Assistant OS.

Add `https://github.com/helios-pulse/heliopulse-releases` under
Settings → Apps → App store → Repositories, install **HelioPulse**, then open
its Web UI. Enable **Show in sidebar** for the solar-power icon. Only active
Home Assistant administrators can use the App UI; no separate login is needed.

This public repository contains installation metadata and release artifacts.
The core source repository is private. Container images are distributed through
public ECR and require no registry credentials.

For sensors in Home Assistant, install/configure Mosquitto and the MQTT
integration. The default `mqtt_mode: auto` uses the Supervisor MQTT service.
Configure your devices in HelioPulse, using a distinct topic prefix if you run
more than one instance. Updates are managed from the Home Assistant App page.

Supported image architectures: **aarch64** and **amd64** on Home Assistant OS.
Ingress/admin SSO, simulated telemetry, MQTT Discovery and cold backup/restore
have been exercised in QEMU. USB/RS485, ESP32 and physical Pi/x86 acceptance
remain pending. This is an App, not a HACS integration; the App store is not
available in Home Assistant Container.

The App has independent versions (`ha-v*`). Every image identifies its App
version, core base version and exact source commit. Stable hardware support is
pending; the initial release remains **experimental**.
